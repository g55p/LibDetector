# RESULTS
We have included the results of analyzing nearly 21,000 APK's by LibDetector in May of 2016 in this folder. The contents of the files and folders are as follows:

- ```LibDetector Results Per App.zip```: The library match results per APK reported by LibDetector 
- ```LibUse.txt```: Counts the number of APKs consuming each version of a library, and lists them for each version
- ```APKLibUse.xslx```: Combines the library use report from LibDetector with each APK's meta data
- ```LibVersionUseFrequency.xlsx```: Plots the frequency of use of each version of a library. Multiple versions of an app are filtered out.
- ```LibUseTable.xlsx```: Shows the proportion of apps using a version of a library that is 1 minor version, and  1 major version behind.
- ```Mann Whitney.xlsx```: Reports the rating of apps which use newer versions of a library versus those that use an older version. The comparison is done using the Mann Whitney U Test. Apps with fewer than 10 ratings are filtered out to minimize rating skews. 
- ```Figures Directory```: Contains all of the tables and figures generated from the data.
